# 20 days of Advent of Code 2023.

## Description
My goal with this was to learn Rust. Considering that goal, most of the solutions are 'over-engineered'. I stopped after finishing day 20 because the solutions became more mathematical focused, so I wasn't growing my Rust knowledge further. 
- All days feature multiple tests for correctness. 
- Some days leverage unique data from my own input, so the solutions are not guaranteed to work on any arbitrary input.
- Most solutions aren't 'optimal', so some take may take minutes to complete.
## Instructions
All solutions require inputs located at resources/inputs/day_XX.txt.
"resources/inputs/day_1.txt"

`cargo run {DAY} {PART}`
`cargo run 5 1` to run solution for day 5 part 1
